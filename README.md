# friendFinder

The purpose behind this app is portraying a list of "friends" added to the array while simultaneously allowing the user to take a survey and analyze which friend best aligns with their personality. At the same time, the user's profile is added to the array of friends for future comparisons.

This app utilizes the Express npm package alongside the Path npm package to allow the server to run the webpage. This overall involves use of Node.js.

The user can use this app via either looking at the home page or completing the survey included.
